    <h3>Ingredents for 4 arepas</h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>Arepa dough</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of Pre-Cooked Corn Meal Flour. &#40;I <strong>HEAVILY</strong> recommend that you use P.A.N. Yellow Corn Flour for authenticity&#41;</li>
            <li>2 and &#188; cups of warm water.</li>
            <li>1 tsp of salt.</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of cooking oil.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Reina Pepiada filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 shredded cooked chicken breast.</li>
            <li>2 cilantro branches.</li>
            <li>1 small clove of garlic.</li>
            <li>1 medium size onion.</li>
            <li>1 ripe avocado.</li>
            <li>3 tbsp of mayonnaise.</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of olive oil.</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of lemon juice.</li>
            <li>salt to taste.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>For the arepas:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour the warm water in a mixing bowl, then add the salt and 1 tbsp of oil.</li>
            <li>Slowly add the flour into the mixing bowl while stirring constantly. Do this until the dough amasses without clumps.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 4 equal-sized balls, using your hands to shape them into a sphere.</li>
            <li>Pre-heat the remaining tablespoon of oil on a large skillet at medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Once hot, place the dough balls into the skillet, cover, and let cook for 5 minutes. Afterwards, uncover and flip the arepas to the other side, and let cook for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once done cooking, set the arepas aside to rest.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>For the filling:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the avocado and mash the insides. Spray with a few drops of lemon juice to preserve its color.</li>
            <li>Cut the onion into small cubes, chop the cilantro into fine pieces and mince the garlic clove.</li>
            <li>Place the cut vegetables into a bowl and mix in the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, mayonnaise, and mashed avocados. Mix until a homogeneous paste forms.</li>
            <li>Add the shredded chicken breast and mix everything with a wooden spoon.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>The final product</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Use a knife to slit open the arepas by cutting through the middle of disc horizontally. Remove the excess dough. &#40;feel free to eat it!&#41;</li>
            <li>Replace the dough with the prepared filling. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>

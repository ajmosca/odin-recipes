    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>1 lb. of dried spaghetti</li>
        <li>&#189; cup of olive oil</li>
        <li>6 to 8 cloves of sliced garlic</li>

        <li>&#40;Optional&#41; Grated parmesan</li>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook until <em>almost</em> al dente &#40;yes, it is important that it's not fully cooked yet&#41;</li>
        <li>About 3 minutes after you added the pasta to the boiling water, heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Once hot, add the garlic and red pepper flakes and saut&eacute; for 3-5 minutes until the garlic is golden.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If the garlic is done before the pasta is ready, remove the pan from the heat. Do this to avoid burning the garlic.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Once the pasta is ready, transfer the pasta into the saut&eacute; pan, along with &#189; cup of pasta water.</li>
        <li>Toss the pasta continously until its evenly coated by the garlic sauce. Add a bit more pasta water if the sauce is too dry.</li>
        <li>Add any extra salt/red pepper flakes to taste and garnish with parsley/parmesan. Enjoy!</li>
